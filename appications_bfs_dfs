1. Breadth First Search (BFS) is used to find the shortest path and minimum spanning tree for unweighted graphs.
2.GPS Navigation systems use BFS to find all neighboring locations.
3. Path Finding: We can specialize the DFS algorithm to find a path between two given vertices
4. Finding Strongly Connected Components of a graph
